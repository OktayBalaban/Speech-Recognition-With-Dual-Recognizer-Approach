# SpeechRecognition

This speech recognition project is implemented for improved recognition of certain commands using vosk library.

In so many applications, speech recognition is only necessary for a several commands. However, most of the time, the commands, which are generally 1-2 words long, are getting misrecognized.

This algorithm solves this problem for the purpose of better recognition when only a several commands are necessary to be recognized.
